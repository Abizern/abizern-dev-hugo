      <description>I am a freelance and iOS and macOS developer based in London. You can find me online at various places with the username of abizern.
I strive to write modern and maintainable code. Primarily I work in Swift, having moved on from Objective-C, but I&amp;rsquo;ve also played around with Ruby, Python, Haskell, and Common Lisp.
I organise the monthly NSCoder Night London meetup when iOS and macOS developers meet to chat.</description>
