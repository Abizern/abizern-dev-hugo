I am a freelance and iOS and macOS developer based in London. You can find me online at various places with the username of `abizern`.

I strive to write modern and maintainable code. Primarily I work in Swift, having moved on from Objective-C, but I've also played around with Ruby, Python, Haskell, and Common Lisp.

I organise the monthly [NSCoder Night London](http://nscodernightlondon.com) meetup when iOS and macOS developers meet to chat. Unfortunately this has gone on hiatus because of the Pandemic, but I'm looking to start it up again soon.

You can see my old blog over at [abizern.org](https:abizern.org) but I'm going to keep this one just for developer stuff and code.
